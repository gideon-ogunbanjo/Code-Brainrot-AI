ðŸš€ Quick Start
* Requirements
To get started, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.10+
- Gradio (pip install gradio)
- Requests (pip install requests)
- You also need access to a local API service running at http://localhost:11434/api/generate (or a custom URL).

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gideon-ogunbanjo/Code-Brainrot-AI
cd brainrot-ai
```
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set the API URL (optional):
If you're using a custom API URL, set it as an environment variable:

```bash
export API_URL="http://your-api-url/api/generate"
```
4. Run the application:

``` bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser to the provided URL and start chatting with Brainrot AI!

ðŸŒŸ How It Works
- User Input: Enter your coding-related questions in the Gradio textbox.
- API Interaction: The app sends your question (and conversation history) to a locally hosted API for processing.
